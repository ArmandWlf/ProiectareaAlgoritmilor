        • Currently studying engineering at "Aurel Vlaicu University of Arad" and economics at "West University of Timisoara". My passions range from mechanics to programming and finally to economics and law. I started riding a little over 8 years ago. My first motorcycle was an enduro bike (Yamaha YZ250 2t), a 250cc monster with over 50hp. Riding it daily slowly raised my experience and so when I was 16, I passed my driving exam without any problems and started riding legally on the roads. I switched from that YZ250 to a KTM Duke 125 2012. Great starter motorcycle, forgiving your mistakes, with a lot of nifty features. In 1 and 1/2 years, I managed to put 13k kilometers on that odometer. I was riding it day and night, no matter if it was a hot sunny day or a freezing rainy day. My first trip with that small bike was on our great road, the " Transfagarasan " . Later on, when I was 18, I switched to a Yamaha XVS650A ( a little downgrade in terms of electronics). I still ride my XVS650 today with the same large smile since I got it. More about my motorcycles at "My Motorcycle" tab.

        • My YouTube channel was founded in 2017. There I post whatever I find interesting, or captivating. Since my hometown is very small and repetitive I don't post my every ride since it could get boring at some point. By the date of 02.01.2018 I reached 105 subscribers even though I'm not very active with my channel and I'm very thankful of that.
